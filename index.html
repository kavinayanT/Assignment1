      <h2>Hi I'm Kavinayan</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Kavinyan Thayananthakumar

        I’m a second-year student studying Networking Information Technology, and I’m passionate about exploring various areas of tech. Along with networking, I have a strong interest in programming, cybersecurity, and AI. I love learning how to improve systems’ efficiency and security, and recently I’ve been delving into automation and cloud technologies. Programming challenges keep me engaged, and cybersecurity fascinates me because of how critical it is to protect information. AI is an area I’m especially curious about for its potential to transform industries. I’m excited to keep learning and applying my skills in these fields as I move forward! Take a look around this site. I made it myself!</p>
